# Surfs_Up_Challenge_9

# Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to gather weather data in Hawaii to obtain investor funding to open a Surf and Shake shop for locals and tourists.

# Findings
  The results gathered showed close consistancy between temperatures. On average the temperature stayed around 70-75 degrees for the year. It can be said that the lower temp average will prove that a few days may not be sutable for ice cream or surfing where as the hot temp average shows it would be more common and the hot temps will be perfect for the purpose of the shop.
  
 # Conclusion
  In conclusion, the results show clearly that weather temperatures will not drasticly affect the daily running of the shop.
